\chapter{Linear Models}

Reality is too complex. Our mind, no matter how powerful it is, can't keep track of all the messy details that result in some outcome. For example, if you want to understand how fast the car will move when you hit the pedal - you don't want to track every molecule of gasoline, energy released when it's combusted, displacement of the engine's piston, and so on. Instead, we need a simplified version of this reality. We just want to know the relation between \textit{how fast the car goes} and \textit{how hard the pedal is pressed}. This is known as \textit{modelling}.\\

\textit{Why do we care about modelling?} Because it helps us: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Understand}: When you can model something, you grasp the big picture. You know what variables matter and how they interact.
    \item \textbf{Predict}: If you can model the weather, the stock market, or disease spread, you can forecast the future, or at least get close!
    \item \textbf{Control}: Once you understand how things work through a model, you can make decisions to steer the outcome the way you want.
\end{itemize}
